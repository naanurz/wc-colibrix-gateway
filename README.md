# WooCommerce Colibrix Gateway Payment

WordPress plugin for WooCommerce that adds payments via Colibrix Gateway.

The plugin registers two payment methods:

- `Colibrix Gateway - Card` for bank card payments
- `Colibrix Gateway - APM` for alternative payment methods

## Main functionality

- creates a payment in Colibrix Gateway during checkout
- redirects the customer to the external payment page
- receives webhook notifications from Colibrix and updates the WooCommerce order status
- returns the customer back to the store after payment
- saves `tracking_id` and `payment UID` in order meta
- shows payment data in the WooCommerce admin area
- supports refunds via API for the card payment method
- supports WooCommerce HPOS
- supports WooCommerce Cart & Checkout Blocks
- lets merchants customize checkout title, description, and up to 3 payment method icons
- writes debug logs for API requests and responses into WooCommerce logs

## Supported payment methods

### 1. Card

### 2. APM

## Payment flow

1. The customer selects a Colibrix payment method at checkout.
2. The plugin builds a payload and sends it to the Colibrix API.
3. WooCommerce moves the order to `on-hold` if the payment is not confirmed yet.
4. The customer is redirected to the Colibrix payment page.
5. After payment, Colibrix sends a webhook to WooCommerce.
6. The plugin verifies the `X-Signature`, finds the order, and updates its status:
   - `success` or `settlement in progress` -> the order is marked as paid
   - `failed` -> the order is moved to `failed`
   - `pending` or `new` -> the order remains `on-hold`

## WooCommerce settings

Each payment method has the following settings:

- `Enable/Disable`
- `Title`
- `Description`
- `Icons` (up to 3 image URLs / Media Library picker shown at checkout)
- `API Base URL`
- `Project ID`
- `API Key`
- `Signature Key`
- `Test mode`
- `Debug log`

Important: the code uses a development `API Base URL` by default. For production, replace it in the WooCommerce settings.
